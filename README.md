# Victor November Discord Bot
- This is a rewrite of an old personal discord bot using .NET 8 and DSharpPlus.
- One might say this is a place where I'll try and overengineer things (or maybe just write bad code) for the sake of it. At the end of the day, nobody cares.

## Prerequisites
- .NET 8
- SQL Server (or suffer through migrations to switch to SQLite)
- Google Gemini API key (good luck with the free tier)

## Contributions
This is a personal project and I’m not accepting pull requests at this time.
Feel free to fork it and experiment on your own.
